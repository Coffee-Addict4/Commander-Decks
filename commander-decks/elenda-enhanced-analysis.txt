# ELENDA, THE DUSK ROSE - DECK ANALYSIS & ENHANCEMENT
# Following MTG Optimizer Guidelines (MCP-Integrated)

## COMMANDER ANALYSIS
**Elenda, the Dusk Rose** (4 CMC - 1/1 Lifelink)
- Grows via +1/+1 counters when creatures die
- Creates vampire tokens equal to power when she dies
- Key synergies: Sacrifice outlets, death triggers, +1/+1 counters, tokens

## CURRENT DECK ANALYSIS (Counted: ~180 cards mainboard - OVER LIMIT)

### EFFICIENCY SCORING ISSUES:
1. **MANA CURVE PROBLEMS**:
   - Too many high CMC recursion spells (6+ mana)
   - Insufficient 1-2 CMC early game pieces
   - Missing critical ramp package

2. **REDUNDANCY VS EFFECTIVENESS**:
   - 14+ Mill cards with minimal synergy payoff
   - 30+ Recursion effects (excessive)
   - Weak removal suite (only 2 dedicated removal spells)

3. **MISSING CORE COMPONENTS**:
   - No mana ramp (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, etc.)
   - Insufficient sacrifice outlets (only 3)
   - No lands in mainboard (critical error)
   - Missing key combo pieces

### POWER EVALUATION GAPS:
- No infinite combos despite aristocrats theme
- Weak win conditions beyond Elenda token swarm
- Missing protection for key pieces
